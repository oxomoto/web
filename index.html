	<span id="content">
   Endless scrolling, looking through infinite amounts of data, liking, searching, for that one thing that'll bring some more happiness. Am I interacting with someone if I like their picture? Is my presence acknowledged? Presence. Projecting my physical body through the vast space of the net. Pushing my inner soul out on a lifeboat and hoping to meet another amidst the crashing waves of the ocean. On diffuse nos facettes dans l'espoir d'avoir un retour, une interaction. Scroll, scroll, images flying past, too perfect to be real but what is real anymore? As we consume all the media we start to be brainwashed by it, expecting to deserve a perfect life. Don't we all deserve a perfect life? Why don't I have it? I need this jacket to be empowered, to really feel myself, consume to not be consumed. But is that really it? We consume and get consumed, we consume and show off on social media to say that we exist. More than that, that we live, that we are present. This stream of words is flowing through my fingers as I type this but thanks to my short attention span, I keep on checking else where for the latest news, images or message. A like? My movies, songs are logged and tracked on the web, is it for me or is it to show others that my interests are cool, that I'm interesting. Nothing's real if it isn't logged on, ticked off, checked in, liked. </span>
